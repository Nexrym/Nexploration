# Welcome to Dragon 'Nex'ploration! 

I'm currently working on creating a set of trails through all of Cantha to aid in map completion, aquiring mastery points, JP's, as well as a few achievement points.

To get this pack to work, simply drop it into (wherever you have taco located)\Taco\POIs folder and you'll be set to go.
